    <li>
      <h3>Topic Family</h3>
      <p>It is clear the picture of what a family looks like has transformed over the past few decades and families are now generally more fragmented. Some would say that couples parting ways is understandable as they are just not meant to be together, however others feel this could adversely affect a strong family bond. </p>
      <p>Indeed, we should not only consider one country when looking at the family dynamic. In some cases a couple may not have a choice as to exactly how many children they wish to have. For example, in times of overpopulation in China, the government has stipulated that parents must only produce one child. Furthermore, in western society, many social issues possibly stemming from inadequate education, poverty and drug and/or alcohol abuse, have resulted in the breakdown of the family unit. Therefore, today, single parents must fend for themselves to look after loved ones, without the moral or financial support from a partner who may have no involvement or simply does not care. </p>
      <p>The question arises as to whether a different outlook for families poses threats or benefits. It is likely that Chinese people feel aggrieved when they cannot plan their family just how they want it. Nevertheless, from their government’s standpoint it is clear that balancing the economy is a chief concern to ensure there is not an undersupply of jobs. Also, while single parents may find looking after their children a challenge, it could be argued that it will make them stronger and more independent. Consequently, these traits might brush off on their offspring. </p>
      <p>In summary, it is clear that broken families are likely due to various (mostly) uncontrollable governmental and social factors. That said, I personally believe that a weakened family unit could lead to wider issues to the detriment of society.</p>

      <h3>Topic Public Park</h3>
      <p>While many people recognize the importance of having access to public parks, others argue that this space could better serve communities by developing housing or businesses there. Although it is undeniable that such properties would create jobs and boost the local economy, I would argue that the green space in cities serves an equally important purpose in local people’s lives and that neighborhood parks can be maintained while also being used to generate revenue for cities. </p>
      <p>First of all, access to green space is essential for human happiness, and this is especially important in crowded cities. Parks offer people an escape from crowds and traffic which is beneficial to individuals’ health as well as to the well-being of a community. One could argue that having a collectively healthier and happier society would increase productivity in all facets of commerce and even reduce some types of crime. </p>
      <p>In addition to providing a place for people to relax, local parks can be used to generate revenue in several ways. Cities can use their parks to sponsor events such as art fairs and music festivals and allow local shops and restaurants to sell their goods during the events. This would directly benefit local businesses as well as bring the community together. City governments could also establish community gardens in their parks and rent individual plots to local residents. A project such as this would benefit the city economically while providing a community garden to source a farmers’ market in the park. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the argument that city parks would be better used as housing or commercial zones. My belief is that parks play an important role in human happiness and can also be used to boost local economies while creating a sense of community.</p>

      <h3>Topic Education</h3>
      <p>With the invention of the Internet and all its possibilities, the traditional educational setting of a room full of students with a teacher standing in front giving instruction, has been challenged. It has been predicted that this style of teaching will soon vanish but I’m quite confident that the traditional classroom may diminish but will never disappear. </p>
      <p>For university students, it is certainly true that there are numerous benefits to distance learning. Lectures can be viewed on a computer from anywhere the Internet is available and often whenever it is convenient. Nowadays this is becoming more common, and the trend will most likely continue to grow. However, distance learning is not really feasible when it comes to elementary and high school students who lack the maturity for self-study and need face-to-face interaction with a teacher. </p>
      <p>There are other drawbacks to eliminating the traditional classroom. For example, it is difficult for students to engage in classroom discussions with each other through a computer and as a result the classroom dynamic will probably suffer due to the absence of energy in the lessons. What is more, without a classroom atmosphere, students, who get most of their knowledge from the teacher, will miss out on learning from each other. It is also important to remember that courses such as chemistry and biology are interactive and require a lab setting, so distance learning is not really possible. </p>
      <p>On balance, the elimination of classroom learning will continue, but this trend will be limited to mostly adult education and courses which do not require an interactive academic environment. I’m quite sure that thirty years from now students and teachers will still be spending time together in the classroom.</p>

      <h3>Topic Health</h3>
      <p>In the past two decades, there has been a significant change in eating habits with a shift to more unhealthy convenience foods that can be consumed on the go. Although this has resulted in some negative consequences, it is possible to mitigate them if governments and citizens take action together.
      </p>
      <p>The increase in the consumption of fast food has led to serious health effects in today’s society. The first problem is that many people no longer have time to prepare and sit down to healthily cooked meals, so instead turn to fast food, which has led to soaring obesity rates. In addition, it is cited that unhealthy foods are substantially cheaper and are therefore consumed in greater volume by the working classes as opposed to more expensive fresh foods such as fish, fruit and vegetables. A third issue is that the unhealthy chemicals and preservatives in processed foods have been directly attributed to causing fatal health issues such as cardiovascular disease and cancer.
      </p>
      <p>There are several measures that governments could take to lessen the impact of the aforementioned problems. Regarding the time constraints of society, laws to restrict employee working hours and the enforcement of longer lunch breaks could encourage people to change their eating habits. To address cost issues, governments could implement higher taxation levies on unhealthy foods and use the revenues generated to subsidize fresh foods for working class families. Governments should also directly address the production methods of mass processed foods with the manufacturers and implement tougher restrictions on the use of harmful preservatives.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, a range of measures can be taken to combat the health issues related to consuming unhealthy food. If such actions are not implemented, it is likely that these problems will become more prevalent and lead to a greater number of unnecessary deaths.</p>

      <h3>Topic Traffic</h3>
      <p>Almost all scientists and policy makers acknowledge the fact that most peoples’ quality of life is being adversely affected by smog and noxious fumes that result from increased vehicle use. Moreover, congestion in city streets as well as highways that link cities and regions is becoming problematic, and it is clear something must be done to address traffic issues. However, I think it is a bad idea to raise gas prices as a way to alleviate the problems, and there are other steps that should be considered first.
      </p>
      <p>Deterring people from using personal vehicles by making gas more costly will only lead to them either spending more of their daily budget on gas or being unable to freely operate their vehicle. For millions of people in countries all over the world who serve as taxi drivers or who commute to work, the loss of a vehicle could mean the end of life itself. But, for people with a comfortable income, spending more to fill the tank of their SUV will be a minor nuisance. The needs of the common workers must be considered as we fix pollution and congestion, in my view.
      </p>
      <p>One step to take would be to raise the tax on the sale of luxury vehicles like Lamborghinis or taxing the ability to own two or more cars. This may reduce careless gas use. Also, tax payers who use public transport could receive a tax incentive to do so. Actually, in many places, investment in a modern and capable public transport system should be the first step governments take. This may lead to a decrease in petrol consumption. The taxes from the luxury cars could, in fact, be used to supplement their construction and maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>In sum, making petroleum more expensive may reduce its use, but not among the right section of the populace. Increases could hurt small businessmen and businesswomen all over the earth. Tax incentives and creating opportunities to use public transport are better ways to reduce gas usage.</p>

      <h3>Topic Technology</h3>
      <p>Over the last two decades almost everyone in the world has bought or used a mobile phone. With this technological development many people feel that there are a lot of advantages but others feel that there may be some disadvantages.Starting with the advantages, it is clear that using mobile phones makes life a lot more convenient. For example, it is possible to contact friends, colleagues and family in just a few seconds at any time of the day or from any location. Also, mobile phones can be used to access a wide variety of data applications such as Camille and social networking sites such as Twitter or Facebook. This is a benefit because people are able to interact on line at all times. Finally mobile phones give security and peace of mind to parents who are able to contact their children easily.
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand many people believe that there are some clear disadvantages. Firstly, mobiles can make people anti-social as they spend more time looking at their phone than at each other. Moreover, many people can become addicted to using smartphone apps, and this can have an effect on their mental and physical health such as their eyesight. It can also affect young people whose studies or work maybe affected by over use of their phones.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, although there are several negatives to using mobile phones, I believe that overall there are more benefits to be had from using these devices. As long as people remember to talk to each other face-to-face and parents control their children’s access to smartphone use, I believe there is no serious problem.</p>

      <h3>Topic Tourism</h3>
      <p>Millions of people visit Big Ben and the houses of parliament in London every year but surprisingly most of these visitors come from outside the UK. In fact, many famous monuments and attractions seem to appeal mainly to visitors rather than to locals. In my view this is because of a lack of knowledge about attractions by locals. Also, people often lack the free time and motivation needed to fully explore and know their home region compared to travelling overseas. To tackle this phenomenon, history in schools should include local knowledge and locations as well as national or international knowledge. In addition, the government should encourage domestic tourism and give incentives for people to travel more domestically.
      </p>
      <p>To begin with, many schools and colleges do not emphasise the importance of regional culture to students, so they are often unaware of historical places and events in their own towns. For example, many Vietnamese people can describe famous sights in South Korea but can often not describe these locations in their own country. To address this, the education system should emphasise local knowledge and history by encouraging students to visit local attractions as well as learning about places overseas.
      </p>
      <p>A second key issue is free time. Many people have limited vacation time and will often choose to travel internationally rather than stay locally when they have a few days off. The government could boost domestic tourism by promoting local events and locations, providing financial incentives to tourist attractions and by making sure that tourist authorities cater to local as well as visiting tourists.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, the best way for tourism to develop is by making sure local sights and events are well-known and promoted both to a national and international market as well as to local consumers. If this is done properly, then tourism and the economy as a whole will thrive.</p>

      <h3>Topic Healthy Food</h3>
